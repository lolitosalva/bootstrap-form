# Another Bootstrap 4 Form (School Lab Project)

With a one time experience with the Design Sprint process in groups, we are tasked to do an individual lab project. The school project contains three problems and must be solved with the help of the design process.

**Problem 1:**
>"Anthony is a Red Seal chef, a blogger, and a foodie. Every week, he asks his reader, from different age groups, to send him recipes wherein he will try to cook, share his techniques, do his best to improve the recipe, and then write a blog about it. He wants to have an interface wherein his readers would use to submit a recipe (basically a form). He uses WordPress for his blogs but is never a programmer or have just enough knowledge about HTML to get by."

- After user testing, I made some changes. First the index page now gives you the option to either submit a recipe by uploading a file or by typing out the recipe itself in a form. Furthermore, both forms are centered. For the "Add Ingredient" section, I removed the "Add Instruction" option as it makes the section confusing. On mobile, it makes the form longer. Instead, I made the instructions as a large text area. Lastly, category section was removed as it was unecessary for the first problem. CSS and JS are updated to match the new html. Javascript is still vanilla though.

- This is a simple form done with Bootstrap 4. Though Bootstrap uses JQuery, I used vanilla JS since I don't know how to use JQuery yet. I'll convert into JQuery once I have plenty of time. No submit functionality is needed, just the design of the interface.
